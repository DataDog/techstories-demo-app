## How do I run TechStories?

TechStories is designed to be run directly on the host machine, as it was primarily built to demonstrate Datadog CI Test Visibility, but its other services can be run in containers using Docker Compose.

Use the following steps to run TechStories:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

1. Set your environment variables by copying the `.env.example` file to `.env` and filling in the values.

1. Install the dependencies for the Next.js application:

  ```bash
  cd techstories-demo-app

If you want to build the application for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then run the production build using the following command:

```bash
